The Trading Economics Application Programming Interface (API) provides direct access to 300.000
economic indicators, exchange rates, stock market indexes, government bond yields and commodity
prices. It allows you to download millions of rows of historical data, to query our real-time
economic calendar and to subscribe to updates. Providing several request methods to query our
databases, with samples available in different programming languages, it is the best way to
export data in XML, CSV or JSON format. The API can be used to feed a custom developed
application, a public website or just off-the-shelf software like Microsoft Excel.

There is no need of a much programming knowledge and anyone can use the API. There is different
**endpoints** to easily get several different data.
The API also has packages to make it simpler to access data. The packages are available for
**Python** and **Node.js**.
